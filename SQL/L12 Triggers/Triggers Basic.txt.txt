What Is a Trigger? A trigger is a PL/SQL block structure that is automatically executed when certain DML (Data Manipulation Language) statements like INSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE are performed on a database table. Triggers are used to automate actions or enforce data integrity rules in response to these events.

Syntax of Triggers:
 The syntax for creating a trigger in Oracle includes various clauses:
•	CREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER trigger_name: Creates a trigger with the specified name, optionally replacing an existing one.
•	{BEFORE | AFTER | INSTEAD OF}: Specifies when the trigger should be executed (before, after, or instead of the event).
•	{INSERT [OR] | UPDATE [OR] | DELETE} [OF col_name]: Determines the triggering event (insert, update, or delete), optionally limited to a specific column.
•	ON table_name: Specifies the table associated with the trigger.
•	REFERENCING OLD AS o NEW AS n: Allows referencing old and new values of data being changed.
•	FOR EACH ROW: Specifies that the trigger is row-level (executed for each affected row).
•	WHEN (condition): Condition for row-level triggers (the trigger is fired only for rows that satisfy the condition).
•	BEGIN...END;: Contains the PL/SQL code to be executed when the trigger fires.

Types of PL/SQL Triggers:
1.	Row Level Trigger: Fires for each row affected by the triggering event.
2.	Statement Level Trigger: Fires once for an entire SQL statement.

PL/SQL Trigger Execution Hierarchy: Triggers are executed in a specific order:
1.	BEFORE statement trigger (if defined)
2.	BEFORE row-level triggers (for each row affected)
3.	AFTER row-level triggers (for each row affected)
4.	AFTER statement trigger (if defined)

Using SYSDATE in Row Level Triggers: Row-level triggers can utilize the SYSDATE function to record the date and time of an event in the trigger code. This can be useful for tracking changes over time.
Cyclic Cascading in Triggers: Care must be taken when defining triggers to prevent cyclic cascading, where triggers fire each other in an infinite loop, potentially causing database crashes.
