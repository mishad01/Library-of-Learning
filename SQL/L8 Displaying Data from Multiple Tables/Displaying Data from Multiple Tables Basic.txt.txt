Objectives:
•Write SELECT statements to access data from more than one table using equality and non-equality joins.
•View data that generally does not meet a join condition by using outer joins.
•Join a table to itself using a self join.
Obtaining Data from Multiple Tables:
•Sometimes, data is needed from more than one table, and you need to establish links between them to retrieve relevant information.

Generating Cartesian Products:
•A Cartesian product is generated when a join condition is omitted.
•It results in all possible combinations of rows from the involved tables.
•Caution should be exercised to avoid unintended large result sets.

Defining Joins:
•SQL provides various ways to define joins, including CROSS JOIN, NATURAL JOIN, JOIN USING, and JOIN ON.

Creating Cross Joins:
•CROSS JOIN returns a Cartesian product of two tables.

Creating Natural Joins:
•NATURAL JOIN automatically joins tables based on columns with the same name and data type.
•Requires columns with identical names in both tables.

Creating Joins with the USING Clause:
•USING specifies a join condition based on a shared column name.
•Simplifies the join process when columns have the same name in both tables.

Creating Joins with the ON Clause:
•ON allows for specifying join conditions explicitly, even when column names differ.
•Useful for complex join conditions and when columns have different names.

Self Join:
•A self join is a join operation where a table is joined with itself.
•Commonly used when dealing with hierarchical data structures, such as organizational hierarchies.

Outer Joins:
•Outer joins retrieve data that might not meet the join condition.
•Three types of outer joins: LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN.
•LEFT OUTER JOIN retrieves all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
•RIGHT OUTER JOIN retrieves all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
•FULL OUTER JOIN retrieves all rows from both tables, including unmatched rows.
