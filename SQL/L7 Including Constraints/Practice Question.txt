1. Add a table-level PRIMARY KEY constraint to the EMP table on the ID column. The
constraint should be named at creation. Name the constraint my_emp_id_pk. Hint: The
constraint is enabled as soon as the ALTER TABLE command executes successfully.
2. Create a PRIMARY KEY constraint to the DEPT table using the ID column. The
constraint should be named at creation. Name the constraint my_deptid_pk. Hint: The
constraint is enabled as soon as the ALTER TABLE command executes successfully.
3. Add a column DEPT_ID to the EMP table. Add a foreign key reference on the EMP table
that ensures that the employee is not assigned to a nonexistent department. Name the
constraint my_emp_dept_id_fk.
4. Confirm that the constraints were added by querying the USER_CONSTRAINTS view.
Note the types and names of the constraints. Save your statement text in a file called

5. Display the object names and types from the USER_OBJECTS data dictionary view for
the EMP and DEPT tables. Notice that the new tables and a new index were created.
If you have time, complete the following exercise:


6. Modify the EMP table. Add a COMMISSION column of NUMBER data type, precision
2, scale 2. Add a constraint to the commission column that ensures that a commission
value is greater than zero.
