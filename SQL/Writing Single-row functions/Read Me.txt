Objectives
After completing this lesson, you should be able to do the following:
 Describe various types of functions available in SQL
 Use character, number, and date functions in SELECT statements
 Describe the use of conversion functions

Lesson Aim
Functions make the basic query block more powerful and are used to manipulate data values. This is the
first of two lessons that explore functions. It focuses on single-row character, number, and date functions,
as well as those functions that convert data from one type to another: for example, character data to
numeric.

Single-Row Functions
These functions operate on single rows only and return one result per row. There are different types of
single-row functions. This lesson covers the following ones: • Character • Number • Date • Conversion

Features of single-row functions include:
• Acting on each row returned in the query
• Returning one result per row
• Possibly returning a data value of a different type than that referenced
• Possibly expecting one or more arguments
• Can be used in SELECT, WHERE, and ORDER BY clauses; can be nested
This lesson covers the following single-row functions:
• Character functions: Accept character input and can return both character and number values
• Number functions: Accept numeric input and return numeric values
• Date functions: Operate on values of the DATE data type (All date functions return a value of DATE
data type except the MONTHS_BETWEEN function, which returns a number.)
                                                           
Case Manipulation Functions:
Character Manipulation Functions
CONCAT, SUBSTR, LENGTH, INSTR, LPAD, RPAD, and TRIM are the character manipulation functions
covered in this lesson.
• CONCATJoins values together (you are limited to using two parameters with CONCAT)
• SUBSTRExtracts a string of determined length
• LENGTHShows the length of a string as a numeric value
• INSTRFinds numeric position of a named character
• LPADPads the character value right-justified
• RPAD: Pads the character value left-justified
• TRIM: Trims heading or trailing characters (or both) from a character string (If trim_character
or trim_source is a character literal, you must enclose it in single quotes.)
