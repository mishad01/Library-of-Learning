Objectives:
•Create users.
•Create roles to facilitate security management.
•Use the GRANT and REVOKE statements to assign and revoke object privileges.
Lesson Aim: In Lab 10, you will learn how to manage user access to a database by creating users, roles, and granting specific privileges. This helps in controlling who can access what within the database.
Controlling User Access: In a multi-user database environment, controlling database access and ensuring security is crucial.

 Oracle provides mechanisms to:
•Control database access.
•Grant access to specific database objects.
•Confirm privileges granted or revoked using the Oracle data dictionary.
•Create synonyms for database objects.

Privileges:
•Privileges in Oracle can be categorized into system privileges and object privileges.
•System privileges grant access to the database system itself (e.g., creating users, removing tables).
•Object privileges allow users to manipulate the content of specific database objects (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE on tables).
•Schemas are collections of database objects (e.g., tables, views) associated with a user.

Creating Users and Granting System Privileges:
•Users are created using the CREATE USER statement.
•System privileges (e.g., CREATE SESSION, CREATE TABLE) can be granted to users using the GRANT statement.

Roles:
•Roles are named groups of related privileges.
•They simplify privilege management and make it easier to revoke and maintain privileges.
•Users can be assigned one or more roles.
•Roles are typically created for specific database applications.

Creating and Granting Privileges to a Role:
•Roles are created using the CREATE ROLE statement.
•Privileges can be granted to roles using the GRANT statement.
•Users are granted roles using the GRANT role TO user statement.

Granting Object Privileges:
•Object privileges (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE) can be granted to users and roles on specific database objects.
•The GRANT statement is used to assign object privileges.

Revoking Object Privileges:
•Object privileges can be revoked from users and roles using the REVOKE statement.

Changing User Passwords:
•Users can change their passwords using the ALTER USER statement.

Dropping Users:
•The DROP USER statement is used to remove a database user.
•It can also remove the user's objects.
•Caution should be exercised when dropping users, especially SYS and SYSTEM users, as doing so can corrupt the database.
