Types of Group Functions:
1.AVG: Calculates the average value of a numeric column, ignoring null values.
2.COUNT: Counts the number of rows that meet specified criteria, including DISTINCT and non-null options.
3.MAX: Retrieves the maximum value of a column, ignoring null values.
4.MIN: Retrieves the minimum value of a column, ignoring null values.
5.STDDEV: Calculates the standard deviation of a numeric column, ignoring null values.
6.SUM: Adds up the values in a numeric column, ignoring null values.
7.VARIANCE: Computes the variance of a numeric column, ignoring null values.

Guidelines for Using Group Functions:
•You can use DISTINCT to consider only non-duplicate values or use ALL to consider all values (default is ALL).
•Group functions work with data types like CHAR, VARCHAR2, NUMBER, or DATE.
•Null values are ignored by group functions, but you can substitute them using the NVL function.
•GROUP BY clause divides rows into groups for summarization.
•Results can be sorted in ascending order by default or overridden with DESC in ORDER BY clause.
•Some functions only work with numeric data types (AVG, SUM, VARIANCE, STDDEV).

Using Group Functions:
•You can use AVG, SUM, MIN, and MAX functions for numeric columns.
•COUNT function can be used to count rows with various options.
•NVL function can be used to include null values in group functions.

GROUP BY Clause:
•GROUP BY clause is used to group rows in a table into sets based on specific columns.
•Columns used in SELECT must also be listed in GROUP BY, or they must be used with an aggregate function.
•WHERE clause can be used to filter rows before grouping.
•You can sort grouped results with ORDER BY.

HAVING Clause:
•HAVING clause is used to filter groups based on aggregate conditions.
•It is used after GROUP BY to filter grouped results.
•You cannot use group functions directly in the WHERE clause; use HAVING instead.

Nesting Group Functions:
•You can nest group functions to a depth of two to perform more complex calculations.
