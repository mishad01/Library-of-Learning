Objectives:
•Describe constraints.
•Create and maintain constraints.

Constraints Overview:
•Constraints are rules enforced at the table level to maintain data integrity.
•Constraints prevent the deletion of a table if there are dependencies.
•Valid constraint types include NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, and CHECK.

Constraint Types and Descriptions:
•NOT NULL: Specifies that a column cannot contain a null value.
•UNIQUE: Requires that values in a column or set of columns be unique across all rows in the table.
•PRIMARY KEY: Uniquely identifies each row in the table and enforces uniqueness.
•FOREIGN KEY: Establishes a relationship between a column in the current table and a column in a referenced table.
•CHECK: Specifies a condition that must be true for each row.

UNIQUE Constraint:
•Ensures that values in a specified column or set of columns are unique.
•Allows the input of nulls for the columns, as nulls are considered distinct.
•Example: ALTER TABLE Persons ADD CONSTRAINT uc_PersonID UNIQUE (P_Id, LastName).

PRIMARY KEY Constraint:
•Creates a primary key for the table, uniquely identifying each row.
•Enforces uniqueness and disallows null values in the primary key column(s).
•Example: ALTER TABLE Persons ADD CONSTRAINT pk_PersonID PRIMARY KEY (P_Id).

FOREIGN KEY Constraint:
•Establishes a relationship between a column in the current table and a column in a referenced table.
•Values in the foreign key column must match values in the referenced table's primary key.
•Example: ALTER TABLE Orders ADD CONSTRAINT fk_PerOrders FOREIGN KEY (P_Id) REFERENCES Persons(P_Id).

CHECK Constraint:
•Defines a condition that each row must satisfy.
•Can be applied to a single column or multiple columns.
•Multiple CHECK constraints can be defined on a single column.
•Example: ALTER TABLE Persons ADD CONSTRAINT chk_Person CHECK (P_Id>0 AND City='Sandnes').

Adding and Dropping Constraints:
•Use ALTER TABLE to add or drop constraints.
•You can add constraints like NOT NULL using the MODIFY clause.
•Example: ALTER TABLE my_status MODIFY (person_id NOT NULL).
•Example: ALTER TABLE employees DROP CONSTRAINT emp_manager_fk.

Querying Constraint Information:
•You can query the USER_CONSTRAINTS table to view constraint definitions and names.
•Example: SELECT constraint_name, constraint_type, search_condition FROM user_constraints WHERE table_name = 'EMPLOYEES'.
Viewing Primary Key Information:
•You can query system tables to retrieve primary key information.
•Example: SELECT table_name, column_name, position, status, owner FROM all_constraints WHERE constraint_type = 'P'.
