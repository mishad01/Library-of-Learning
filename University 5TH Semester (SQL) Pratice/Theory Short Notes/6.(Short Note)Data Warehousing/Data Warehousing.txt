Data Warehousing:
• A data warehouse is designed to provide strategic information for decisionmaking.
• Characteristics include being user-driven, storing data for analysis, handling 
complex queries, and being flexible and interactive.
• Bill Inmon introduced four characteristics: subject-oriented, integrated, timevariant, and non-volatile.

Dimensional Modeling:
• Dimensional modeling organizes data into subject-oriented models suitable 
for analysis.
• Star Schema: A central fact table linked to dimension tables, suitable for 
simple queries.
• Snowflake Schema: Normalized dimension tables, but can lead to complexity 
and slower queries.
• Star Flake Schema: A hybrid schema with fact and both denormalized and 
normalized dimension tables.

OLTP vs. OLAP:
• OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) is for day-to-day operations, whereas 
OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) supports analysis.
• Data in OLTP is current and normalized, while data in OLAP is historical, 
summarized, and used for queries.
• OLTP has quick response times, while OLAP's response time varies based on 
complexity.
• OLTP supports numerous users, while OLAP has fewer users.

Data Mining:
• Data mining analyzes large databases to discover patterns and rules.
• It's used for prediction, association, classification, and clustering.
• Association rules find relationships between items, classification predicts 
classes, and clustering groups similar data points.

Classification:
• Classification predicts the class of new instances based on existing data.
• Decision Tree Classifiers use a tree structure with leaves representing classes 
and internal nodes representing attributes.
• Support measures how often a rule applies, and confidence measures rule 
accuracy.

Association Rules:
• Association rules find correlations between items.
• Support measures the frequency of items' co-occurrence, while confidence 
measures the accuracy of predictions.

Clustering:
• Clustering groups similar data points together.
• Hierarchical clustering creates clusters in a tree structure.
• It's used in various domains, such as biology and recommendation systems
