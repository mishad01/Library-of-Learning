RAID
RAID Overview:
• RAID is a technology used to enhance the performance and reliability of data storage 
systems.
• It involves grouping two or more drives to work in parallel to improve read/write 
performance.
• Different RAID levels offer various combinations of performance, redundancy, and fault 
tolerance.
RAID Levels:
RAID 0 - Striping:
• Data is split into blocks and written across all drives for improved I/O 
performance.
• Offers excellent performance for non-critical data.
• No fault tolerance; if one drive fails, all data is lost.
RAID 1 - Mirroring:
• Data is stored twice by writing to both data and mirror drives.
• Offers excellent read speed and comparable write speed.
• Provides data redundancy; if one drive fails, data can still be accessed.
RAID 5 - Striping with Parity:
• Data blocks are striped across drives, and parity data is distributed.
• Offers good read performance and decent write performance.
• Can withstand a single drive failure without data loss.
RAID 6 - Striping with Double Parity:
• Similar to RAID 5 but with double parity, providing more fault tolerance.
• Can survive two simultaneous drive failures.
• Slower write performance due to additional parity calculations.
RAID 10 - Mirroring and Striping:
• Combines RAID 1 and RAID 0.
• Provides security through mirroring and speed through striping.
• Fast rebuild time after drive failure.
RAID Levels 2, 3, 4, and 7:
• These levels exist but are less common.
• RAID 2 uses memory-style error-correcting code (ECC).
• RAID 3 and 4 use bit or block-interleaved parity.
RAID Considerations:
• RAID is not a substitute for backup; it provides fault tolerance, not data protection from 
all scenarios.
• Backing up data is crucial for safeguarding against multiple types of data loss, including 
hardware failures, accidents, theft, and user errors
