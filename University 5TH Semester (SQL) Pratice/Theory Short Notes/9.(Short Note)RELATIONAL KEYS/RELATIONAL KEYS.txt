RELATIONAL KEYS
There are six keys those play important role in relational database
• Super key
• candidate key (THESE 3 ARE USED IN DESIGNING PHASE)
• Surrogate key
• Primary key
• Composite key (THESE 3 ARE IMPLEMENTATION CONCEPT)
• Foreign key
Supper Key => Set of columns that can uniquely identify the occurrences of each entity.
Example: supper key is (Doctor ID, Patient ID, Appointment Date, Time, and room).
Candidate Key => set of a supper key that has minimum number of attributes necessary for unique 
identification of each entity occurrences.
The candidate depends on business rules of an organization.
Example:
Business Rule 1: Patient can see doctor more than one in a day
Candidate Key (Doctor ID, Patient ID, Appointment Date, Time, and room). 
Business Rule 2: Patient can see doctor more than once in any day but in different room. 
Candidate Key (Doctor ID, Patient ID, Appointment Date, and Time).
Surrogate key => used to uniquely identify of each entity occurrences when a candidate key is 
very long.
Example: The surrogate key for the appointment table is appointment ID.
Primary key => An attribute that uniquely identifies each row in a table. A PRIMARY KEY 
constraint creates a primary key for the table. Only one primary key can be created for an each 
table.:
Composite key => A composite key is made by the combination of two or more columns in a 
table that can be used to uniquely identify each row in the table when the columns are combined 
uniqueness of a row is guaranteed
Foreign key => Foreign keys are used to represent One-to-Many relationship, is an attributes of 
one table that serves as a primary key of another table in the same database
