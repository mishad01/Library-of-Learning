//Humanway of finding divisiors of a Number
//This is How to enumerate the divisors of  n in O(âˆšn) time complexity
/* 
 1 x 100 = 100;
 2 x 50 =  100;
 4 x 25 =  100;
 5 x 20 =  100;
10 x 10 =  100;
a  x  b = n;

so basically in human way the loop will continue till a*b<=n and a<=b 
And we will insert into vector,set or arrary if(n%i==0) and (n/i);
