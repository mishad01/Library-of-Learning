/*he given code appears to be an implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find prime numbers up to a given positive integer 'n'. Here's what we can learn from this code:

It defines a constant N as 10^5 + 9 (1e5 + 9), which is likely an upper limit for the range of numbers to consider for prime number generation.

It initializes a boolean array f of size N, where each element represents whether a number is marked as composite (false for prime, true for composite).

It reads an integer n from the standard input, which represents the upper bound for finding prime numbers up to 'n'.

It initializes f[1] as true since 1 is not a prime number.

It uses a vector v to store the prime numbers found during the iteration.

The code then iterates through numbers from 2 to n. If f[i] is false (indicating that 'i' is prime), it appends 'i' to the vector v and marks all multiples of 'i' as composite by setting f[j] to true for j starting from i + i and incrementing by i until j is less than 'n'.

After the loop, it prints the prime numbers stored in the vector v.*/
