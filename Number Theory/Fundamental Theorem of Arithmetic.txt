If we find divisor of a number.It will always give same divisor. As an example...
12          .      12
4 x 3       .      6 x 2 
2 x 2 x3    .      3 x 2 x 2
This prime factorization is unique for the number 12. No matter how you break down 12 into prime factors, you will always get 2 * 2 * 3.

Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic: Every positive integer greater than 1 can be written as a unique product of prime numbers.

In simpler terms:

Any whole number greater than 1 can be broken down into a set of prime numbers multiplied together.
For example:

Let's take the number 12:

12 can be expressed as the product of the prime numbers 2 and 3: 12 = 2 * 2 * 3.
Importantly, this prime factorization is unique for the number 12. No matter how you break down 12 into prime factors, you will always get 2 * 2 * 3.

The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic is a crucial concept in number theory because it tells us that primes are the building blocks of all positive integers greater than 1, and every positive integer has a unique prime factorization. It has various applications in mathematics and plays a fundamental role in understanding the properties of numbers.
