If we want to count total divisor of a number we cant count it using this method.
288 = 2^5 x 3^2 here total divisor is (5+1)*(2+1)= 18 (We are adding 1 with power because we can form this for 5 in total 6 way and for 2 total 3 way)

Facts:
-A number which has exactly 3 divisors is always a square of a prime! Why?
-A number which has exactly 4 divisors is either of the form p^3 or p∗q where p and q are prime.

NOTE:
1.How to find which numbers have 3 divisors
=>Only prime square have 3 divisor
2.How to find which number have 4 divisors
=>p x q = (1+1) x (1+1) = 4
=>^3 = (3+1) =4
3.How to find maximum divisor from 1.......10^9  (1 to 10^9)?
=> For 100 
1 x 100
2 x 50
4 x 35
5 x 20
10x 10
So total divisor can be 2√n) but we take 3√n

=>so for 10^9 we will take divisor 10^3 (Because 3√10^9 = 10^3(1000) )
